Because signals from wireless routers and access points can travel more than 200 feet, you might see more than one network listed when you choose <em>Wireless settings</em>. </p> <P> Make sure you select your wireless network from the list, rather than one located at a nearby neighbor's or a local business. That way, your <script>document.write(ProductShortName);</script> will connect to the network that you control. In addition, the wireless router in your home will generally provide the strongest and most reliable signal for your <script>document.write(ProductShortName);</script> and other devices on your home network. </p> <P>If your <script>document.write(ProductShortName);</script> fails to receive a signal from your preferred network, return to this page and select another network. If this occurs, check your wireless router or access point using another device on your home network, such as a computer. Try to restore service to your own home network before connecting to another network in the list. </p> <br> </span> </div><div id="sideBar"> <msntv:CustomButton onclick="history.go(-1)" id="doneID" label="Done" /> <script>document.all("doneID").focus();</script> </div> </body> </html>
