A home network allows you to connect your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to your home computer via a hub or routing device. You'll be able to use your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to view pictures, listen to music, and watch videos that are stored on your computer.
<p>
<p>
Once you've added your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to your home network and set up file sharing, you'll be able to access files on your computer without signing in to the <script>document.write( ServiceFullName )</script>. Just choose <b>Photos</b>, <b>Music</b>, or <b>Videos</b> from the bottom of the Sign-in page. (Note that you'll occasionally be asked to sign in to verify that your MSN TV account is current.)
<p>
<p>
When you sign in, you can access your Photos, Music, and Videos files, and also take advantage of additional features such as tips and articles.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
An overview of home networking is presented here. If you need more information, sign in to the <script>document.write( ServiceFullName )</script> and choose <b>Help</b> and then <b>Home networking</b>, or go to www.msntv.com.
</p>
</p>
<b>Home networking requirements</b>
</p>
</p>
To connect your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to a home network, you'll need the following (sold separately):
<ul>
<li>A hub or router</li>
<li>Two standard Ethernet cables: one long enough to reach from your computer to your router, and another long enough to reach from your router to your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script>. (<b>Note:</b> For a wireless network, you can substitute a USB wireless dongle or a wireless Ethernet bridge for the Ethernet cable from the router to the <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script>.)</li>
<li>A computer running Windows 98 or later, configured to connect to your network.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
For more information on connecting to a home network, sign in to the <script>document.write( ServiceFullName )</script> and choose <b>Help</b> and then <b>Home networking</b>, or go to www.msntv.com.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
<b>File sharing on your computer</b>
<p>
<p>
To use your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to access folders that are on your computer, you must first designate the folders as shared resources on the network.  File or Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks must be enabled on the computer, and the computer must have at least one shared folder. (If your network has a firewall, you must also adjust the firewall's settings to allow file sharing.)
<p>
<p>
For detailed instructions on setting up file sharing on your computer, go to your computer's online Help and search for <b>sharing files.</b>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
For more information on file sharing, sign in to the <script>document.write( ServiceFullName )</script> and choose <b>Help</b> and then <b>Home networking</b>, or go to www.msntv.com.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Finding connected computers</b>
</p>
</p>
Once you've connected your <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script> to your hub or router, follow these steps to find computers on the network:
<ol>
<li>Turn on the <script>document.write( ProductShortName );</script>. The Sign-in page appears.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Settings</b>, and then choose <b>Mange your home network</b>. The Home Network Settings page appears. You have two options:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Choose the <b>Find</b> button to automatically search for computers that are connected to your home network.</li>
<li>If your network does not use the router to assign IP addresses dynamically and is set up with static IP addresses, you may need to choose the <b>Add</b> button and type in the names of computers on the network.</li>
<p>
<p>
To learn how to find your computer's name, choose the link below:<br>

</span>
</p>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Once you've set up your home network, the names of the computers on the network will appear when you choose an MSN TV feature that supports file sharing, such as Photos, Music, or Videos. If you've given permission to share a file or folder (see "Setting up file sharing" above), you'll be able to view photos, listen to music, or watch videos on your TV.
